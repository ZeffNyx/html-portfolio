<hr/>
<h3>The lion king</h3>
<p>The lion king is the first movie i truely remembered first from a young age of under 6 or 5 !!!!<br/>
Long time ago !!!! More than a decade already !!!!<br/></p>

<p>i find the lion king movie to be very nostalgic to me!<br/> Especially the music in the lion king movie,
i love the "Can you feel the love tonight" song in the movie the most!
The "Can you feel the love tonight" song is also very good on piano!</p>
